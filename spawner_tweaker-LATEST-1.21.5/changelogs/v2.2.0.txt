Improvements from the previous version (Spawner Tweaker v2.1.0):

Features:
-You can now check spawners in an area. Pull up the menu with /trigger search_volume
-You can now transform spawners from one id into another. To pull up the menu, throw a given spawner you wish to transform into while tweaking a spawner whose id you wish to transform from.
-Added a container registry sys for people that want to make randomizers (or \
    if I get around to making a chest randomizer)
-Added a trigger to remove containers from the registry sys based on range
-Added a spawner randomizer with several different randomization settings
-Added a chest randomizer! Only minor limitations.

QOL:
-Prime all spawners function now kills id displays
-Settings preserve when selecting new spawners, add tag st_reset_settings to disable
-Default reselect ticks is now set to 5 (used to be 20)

Bugs:
-None this time!

TODO in future version updates:
Add new blocks to raycast list
