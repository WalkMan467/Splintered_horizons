Improvements from the previous version (Spawner Tweaker v2.0.0):

Features:
-You can now use the highlight trigger to only look for spawners of a specific id with the command /scoreboard players set $highlight_id spawner_tweaker <id>, resets on reload
-ID displays now have their id written to their spawner_tweaker_id score (for easy teleporting)
-If the mapmaker forgets to give the spawner light levels, tweaker sets it to 0-7 block, 0-15 sky
-Dropping a spawner while tweaking will open chat prompts for bulk editing and highlighting

QOL:
-Added failsafe for if updates are triggered on non-spawners
-Hotbar display for light levels now shows 0-15 for light immune values

Bugs:
-Added system failsafe to delete tweaker displays accidentally copied with axiom

TODO in future version updates:
Add new blocks to raycast list
