Improvements from the previous version (Spawner Tweaker v2.2.2 for 1.21.5-1.21.10):

Features:
-Now works up to minecraft 1.21.10
-Added a tutorial and proper welcome message
-Completely reworked the wiki and functionality to work on an in-game menu. Should help to streamline things.
-You can now disable selecting other spawners while tweaking
-Added a bunch of visual select options for registering and tweaking

QOL:
-Spawner ids no longer show up when tweaker is disabled
-Removed tweaker loading message on /reload and login
-Moved most setting confirmations to the actionbar and added sounds
-Quick highlight from spawners now highlights that spawner id for 30s and resets the highlight id variable
-Condensed all triggers into 1 thanks to the new menu
-Reduced the intrusiveness of a large number of visual effects

Bugs:
-Fixed bug with volume markers showing up at times they shouldn't
-Reconfigured the datapack to fix the minecraft duplicate coordinate bug (infinite register bug)

TODO in future version updates:
Add new blocks to raycast and containers lists - 1.21.9 blocks
